# webscraper
A practice web scraper that scrapes books.toscrape.com.

## What is this:
This web scraper isn't very practical, but was intended as a way to learn about how to make one that is.

## Inspiration:
Before LibraryThing was free for users, and before the OCLC test project ended, I had the idea of writing a program that would accept barcodes and return call numbers by scraping the OCLC website, thus allowing me to organize my personal library for free.

## Prerequisites
Python3, BeautifulSoup, lxml parser, requests

## Using this webscraper
It will ask you which genre of book you want to scrape from, and will give you the option to go either page by page of listings, or scrape all of the pages without asking. The results are ammended to a file called results.txt.

## How it was built
This was built with VS Code

## What I learned
I learned how webscrapers work

## What's next
I'm not sure how I will use this in the future, but it may be a useful tool for building a database to help train AI.
